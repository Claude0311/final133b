# RRT Based Motion Planner for Non-Holonomic Mobile Robots


We considering the problem of motion planning for non-holonomic mobile robots (wheeled systems) such as cars using RRT-based (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) algorithms. The planner has to be able to efficiently and effectively plan through a map avoiding obstacles in various situations such as:


- Narrow Parking Garages
- Parallel Parking
- Narrow Streets
